# Introduction
*YelpCampDeployment* is a refactor of the yelpCamp project developed under the direction of [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), with a shoutout to Ian Schoonover and Zarko Maslaric. It allows a user to accomplish the following:

 * create and manage a profile
 * create and manage campgrounds
 * comment on existing campgrounds
 * browse campgrounds and other registered users
 * search (fuzzy) for campgrounds and registered users
